Amazon S3 and dbt ELT Pipeline Project, tailored to use PostgreSQL and the AdventureWorks 2022 (ADW 2022) dataset:

1. Objective
Design and implement an ELT pipeline using Amazon S3 for data storage, dbt for data transformation, and PostgreSQL as the data warehouse. Utilize the AdventureWorks 2022 dataset to demonstrate how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights.



check data warehousing for ADW and use those tables (learn about SSIS projects and store procedures to dbt projects)

Jinja is not an improved version of SQL. Instead, itâ€™s a template engine used in dbt to enhance how you write SQL by making it dynamic and reusable. Think of Jinja as a helper tool that works alongside SQL, not as a replacement.
